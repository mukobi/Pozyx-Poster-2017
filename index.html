            Many high school and college physics courses require labs with innacurate measuring from timing by hand, visually estimating distance, etc.
            Pozyx, a super accurate positioning system by Pozyx Labs, could be implemented as a physics data tool if useful software were written for it to do so.

              <li>A uniform software solution for interfacing with Pozyx and using its hardware for physics education.</li>
              <li>Commands to the hardware must implement a Pozyx library written in Python, so most code will be in Python.</li>
              <li>Graphical user interface (GUI) needed for easy interaction in the classroom, and Java using the JavaFX package chosen for portability and simple development.</li>
              <li>Means to analyze and visualize data both while it is being collected and after it is collected are required.</li>
              <li>Must create a simple, cross-platform installation with streamlined usage patterns so educators and students can quickly and easily start using the software.</li>

            My solution implements the Pozyx library to allow the collection, storing, and visualization of data from the Pozyx devices. Additionally, my graphical user interface built in Java with JavaFX abstracts the scripts into easy user interaction.

            One test of the system was a recreation of a common physics lab: measuring the acceleration due to gravity of a cart on an inclined track and compare it to the theoretical acceleration calculated using kinematics equations. For the 7.126 degree slope tested, the theoretical downward component of the cart's acceleration should be <i>g * sin(ùúÉ) = 1.217 m/s/s</i>. Analyzing the Pozyx data of more than 200 data points collected over 3.5 seconds, the second degree coefficient of the quadratic model of the data which equals <i>¬Ωa</i> was 0.660, so the system measured an acceleration of 1.220 m/s/s. Using <i>error = |theoretical - experimental| / theoretical</i>, percent error was 0.246%.

            My research shows that my implementation of a software abstraction over the Pozyx positioning hardware has been successful in creating a tool to easily and effectively improve physics labs.
            <ul>
              <li>I successfully created working data collection and user interface software for the system.</li>
              <li>My design of the software shows plenty of potential for further improvement and tailoring towards education.</li>
              <li>When tested with a physics lab, I was able to easily collect data that had an outstanding &#60;1% error.</li>
            </ul>
            However, there are still some limitations of the system:
            <ul>
              <li>Cross-platform development is prone to bugs and edge cases, so my software is most stable on Windows.</li>
              <li>The Pozyx Python library is still being developed by Pozyx Labs, so both breaking changes and beneficial improvements must be considered in the future.</li>
              <li>Currently, the price of each Pozyx device at around $150 USD could be rather steep for many educators, but prices of Pozyx or similar hardware solutions will likely drop with greater production and implementation.</li>
